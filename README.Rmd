# ANOVA

The data in the following table belongs to three investment portfolios in profits in millions of dollars,  during the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.
The first portfolio is from pharmaceutical companies, the second portfolio is from banking instruments and the last investment portfolio is from construction companies. 



```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

## What has been the most convenient year for these investment portfolios?



```{r , echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
instruments<-c(50,52,54,53,51,65,66,69,64,68,30,32,34,33,31)
portfolios<-factor(rep(LETTERS[1:3],c(5,5,5)))
data.frame(portfolios,instruments)
examp<-data.frame(portfolios,instruments)
summary(aov(instruments~portfolios,examp))


profits<-c(19,24,28,14,50,52,48,51,14,12,17,6,43,45,42,42,23,30,26,12,48,50,51,53)

year<-factor(rep(c("Year 2015","Year 2016","Year 2017"),c(8,8,8)))

portfolios<-factor(rep(LETTERS[1:2],c(4,4)))
examp<-data.frame(year,portfolios,profits)
examp
summary(aov(profits~year+portfolios+year*portfolios,examp))

tapply(examp$profits,list(examp$year,examp$portfolios),mean)
tapply(examp$profits,examp$year,mean)
tapply(examp$profits,examp$portfolios,mean)

col1<-c(2,3,4)
interaction.plot(examp$portfolios,examp$year,examp$profits,fun=mean,col=col1)



col2<-c(2,3,4)
interaction.plot(examp$year,examp$portfolios,examp$profits,fun=mean,col=col2)
```

According to our ANOVA, marginal means and the interaction graph, the most convenient year for our portfolios was 2017.
